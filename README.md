# Data Science Coding Challenge
1. Feature Engineering Improvements
Weather Data Integration: Ski ticket sales are likely impacted by weather conditions. You could integrate external weather data (temperature, snow depth, etc.) to capture the impact of weather on ticket sales.
Holiday and Event Flags: Adding features that flag public holidays, ski festivals, or special events could improve the model. These events often lead to spikes in ticket sales.
Lag Features: Create lag features (e.g., sales from the previous day, week, or month) to capture any autocorrelation patterns. This can help the model understand sales trends based on previous behavior.
Rolling Averages: Adding rolling averages (e.g., 7-day, 30-day averages) of ticket sales can help capture longer-term trends and smooth out noise.
2. Model Enhancements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform a hyperparameter search using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for the XGBoost model. Tuning parameters such as learning_rate, max_depth, n_estimators, and subsample can significantly improve model performance.
Ensemble Models: Consider using an ensemble of multiple models (e.g., combining XGBoost with ARIMA, Random Forest, or Prophet). Ensemble learning can help improve predictive accuracy and robustness.
Boosting Variants: Try other boosting algorithms like LightGBM or CatBoost which might perform better on this data depending on the distribution and features.
Cross-Validation: Implement time-series specific cross-validation techniques like TimeSeriesSplit to ensure that the model is validated on data that has a temporal structure.
3. Data Handling
Handling Missing Data: If there are missing data points in the time series, explore different methods for imputation (e.g., forward filling, interpolation, or predictive imputation).
Outlier Detection: Check for outliers or sudden spikes in ticket sales that might distort the model. Use techniques like IQR (Interquartile Range) or z-scores to detect and handle outliers.
